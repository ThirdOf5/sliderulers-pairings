Hey Sliderulers captain!
Welcome to the pairing program
I have included a couple example files to help you get started. The program can't handle not multiples of couples per dance (usually 3) yet so add in some placeholders if it's not even and then substitute them in.

You need a leads.txt and a follows.txt with each person's name and their ranking from 1-3 next to them. Again, example files included. Just plug those in and make sure the constants at the top are what you want and run. It should print them out in the console with the rounds, who is in front and then an evaluation letting you know how it did.

-----DISCLAIMER------

This program is not perfect unfortunately but it can help you get started and make this process a whole lot easier. Hopefully over the summer I've had time to revise it a make it perfect but if not sorry about that. the evaluation is partially so if it stops early it can show you what needs fixing, ie who hasn't gone twice and leads not gone in front. It will also tell you if it's first matchups don't work and if it ran again. I have breakpoints at lines 160 and 215 and I highly recommend you do so as well so you can stop it before it runs again so you can see if you want that combination with a little tweaking. If any other comp sci people look at this code, first of all I'm sorry. It's gross I know but it *mostly* gets the job done. 

BEST OF LUCK!
